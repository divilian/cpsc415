# Throughout this file, you can refer to the global variables "suspects",
# "weapons", and "rooms", which are tuples of "Card" objects telling you what
# cards are in the game, period. You can even try this right now:
#
# >>> print(suspects)
# >>> print(weapons)
# >>> print(rooms)
#
# Each Card object has a name and a category:
# >>> print(f"{suspects[0].name} is a {suspects[0].category}")
# mustard is a SUSPECT
